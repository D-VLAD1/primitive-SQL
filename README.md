# primitive-SQL

Here, I'm trying to implement my primitive version of SQL database using AVL trees.

### AVL Tree
AVL Tree is one type of the self-balancing trees. It is balanced by height of
the subtrees of the node. It is convenient because we can access to each node
quickly. It takes almost the same time with small deviation to access 
root node and leaf node due to `balancing`.

### Functionality
Creating, editing, deleting tables and attributes using SQL-like language.
